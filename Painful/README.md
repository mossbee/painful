The code above uses the State design pattern to control the three drawing tools: Pencil, Rectangle, and Eraser. The IDrawingTool interface defines the contract for the state objects, and the SetCurrentTool method sets the current state. The OnMouseDown, OnMouseMove, and OnMouseUp methods of the state objects handle the mouse events and update the state accordingly. The Draw method of the state objects is called to draw the shapes on the picture box control.

The Clone method is used to create a copy of the current state when the mouse button is released, so that the same tool can be used for drawing multiple shapes without having to switch tools. This is useful for creating multiple shapes with the same properties, such as color and line thickness.

Double buffering is a technique for drawing graphics that reduces flickering and can improve the overall drawing performance. It works by drawing to a temporary buffer (in this case, a bitmap) first, and then copying the entire buffer to the screen all at once, rather than updating the screen pixel by pixel as the drawing is being done. This reduces the number of times the screen is updated, which can reduce flickering.

In the code you provided, double buffering is implemented by creating a bitmap called buffer and a Graphics object called gBuffer that is associated with the bitmap. When the picture box control is painted, the gBuffer.Clear method is called to clear the bitmap, and then all of the shapes are drawn on the bitmap using the Draw method of the state objects. Finally, the entire bitmap is drawn onto the picture box control using the DrawImageUnscaled method of the Graphics object passed to the Paint event handler. This ensures that the screen is updated all at once, rather than updating it piece by piece as the shapes are being drawn.
